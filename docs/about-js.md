# The JavaScript Component

This is a demo of a back-end project, but one whose code can be run in the browser.

To set that up, we make this an sbt cross-commpilation project and then followed [the scalaJS tutorial for vite.](https://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial/scalajs-vite.html),
which we bootstrapped by running:

```sh
npm create vite@4.1.0
npm install -D @scala-js/vite-plugin-scalajs@1.0.0
```
