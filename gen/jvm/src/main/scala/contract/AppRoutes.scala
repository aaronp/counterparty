/** This trait encapsulates the business logic (services) and the http routes which handle the http
  * requests sent to those services.
  *
  * There are default 'not implemented' implementations for the service.
  *
  * If you wanted fine-grained control over the routes and services, you could extend the
  * cask.MainRoutes and mix in this trait by using this:
  *
  * \{\{\{ override def allRoutes = appRoutes \}\}\}
  *
  * More typically, however, you would extend the 'BaseApp' class
