  *  TODO -
  * 
  * Make these services Programs, and then have their traits extends ProgramApp.
  * 
  * See how using 'trace' could work, where we track the source/target of each call (sent and received w/ time)
  * 
  * Give each ProgramApp an EventBus to send the calls to (w/ timestamps), and see if we can derive the mermaid flow from that
